It patches Outer Wilds to load mods, and provides mods a framework to interact with the game. OWML is inspired by SMAPI for Stardew Valley.\n\n## How it works\n\nOWML does the following:\n1. Patches the game to make it call the mod loader.\n2. Starts the game.\n3. The mod loader loads and initializes installed mods.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith Outer Wilds Mod Manager (recommended):\n1. Download the Mod Manager from the [Outer Wilds Mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/) website.\n2. Use the Mod Manager to install OWML and mods, and start the game.\n\nManual install:\n1. Download latest OWML release and extract the zip file anywhere you want.\n2. [Download Outer Wilds mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods) and put them in the `mods` folder, each mod in a separate folder.\n3. Start the game with OWML.Launcher.exe.\n\n## Uninstall\n- If using Outer Wilds Mod Manager, first refer to it's uninstall guide.\n- If not, delete OWML folder.\n- Verify integrity of game files - OWML edits the game code to load itself, so verification is needed to remove the changes.\n  - Steam : Right click on game > Properties > Local files > Verify integrity of game files\n  - Epic : Three dots next to game > Verify\n\nIf you want to keep mod data intact but still play without mods, verifying the game files is enough. Just make sure to run the game through Steam/Epic, *not* OWML.Launcher.exe.\n\n## For modders\n\nRefer to the sample mods in the source code for examples. These mods are not included in releases.\n\n### Get started\n\n1. Create a C# class library project targeting .Net Framework 4.8.\n2. Install the [OWML Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OWML/).\n3. Reference the following files in {gamePath}\\OuterWilds_Data\\Managed:\n    * Assembly-CSharp.dll\n    * UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll\n    * More Unity DLLs if needed\n4. Inherit from ModBehaviour.\n\t\nFor more info, see [For modders](https://github.com/amazingalek/owml/wiki/For-modders).\n\n## Compatibility\n\n|Version|Compatible|\n|-|-|\n|1.1.10|Yes|\n|1.1.9|Unknown|\n|1.1.8|Unknown|\n|1.0.0 - 1.0.7|No|\n\nOWML is compatible with Echoes of the Eye, and works on both Epic and Steam installations.\n\n## Feedback and Support\n\nOWML is developed by some of the same people making the mods!\nOn the [Outer Wilds Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/9vE5aHxcF9), we are:\n- alek\n- Raicuparta\n- _nebula\n- TAImatem\n\nFeature requests, bug reports and PRs are welcome on GitHub.\n\n## Credits\n\nAuthors:\n* [AmazingAlek](https://github.com/amazingalek)\n* [Raicuparta](https://github.com/Raicuparta/)\n* [_nebula](https://github.com/misternebula)\n* [TAImatem](https://github.com/TAImatem)\n\nContributors:\n* [salomj](https://github.com/salomj) - Helped with menus and inputs.\n* [artum](https://github.com/artumino) - Helped with menus and patchers.\n* [JohnCorby](https://github.com/JohnCorby) - Helped with audio loading stuff.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n* [Outer Wilds](http://www.outerwilds.com)\n* [Outer Wilds on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds)\n* The unnofficial Outer Wilds Discord\n* Inspired by (and some code from) [SMAPI](https://smapi.io)\n* OWML logo banner by _nebula\n\nDependencies:\n* [dnpatch](https://github.com/ioncodes/dnpatch)\n* [dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib)\n* [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX)\n* [ObjImporter](https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=ObjImporter)\n* [NAudio-Unity](https://github.com/WulfMarius/NAudio-Unity)\n* [Gameloop.Vdf](https://github.com/shravan2x/Gameloop.Vdf)\n","externalImages":{"owmllogo.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/892977233-w800h694finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/892977233-w800h694finside.webp","width":800,"height":347,"format":"png"},"https://img.shields.io/github/license/amazingalek/owml?style=flat-square":{"url":"/images/optimized/1588328541-w78h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1588328541-w78h20finside.svg","width":78,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/amazingalek/owml?style=flat-square":{"url":"/images/optimized/1231135184-w94h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1231135184-w94h20finside.svg","width":94,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/amazingalek/owml?label=last%20release&style=flat-square":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1339694593-w146h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1339694593-w146h20finside.svg","width":146,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/amazingalek/owml/total?style=flat-square":{"url":"/images/optimized/-408072536-w100h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-408072536-w100h20finside.svg","width":100,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/amazingalek/owml/latest/total?style=flat-square":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1998305180-w140h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1998305180-w140h20finside.svg","width":140,"height":20,"format":"svg"}}}
