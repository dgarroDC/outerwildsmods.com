{"readme":"# Hiker's Mod\nThe aim of this mod is to make the player move around more intuitively. All features of the mod are individually toggleable, so you can disable features if you don't like them.  \n  \nThis mod makes jumping way more responsive by having the character jump immediately once the jump button is pressed. It also makes it so that the player can move at full speed in any direction, not just forward. Also, you can tweak the movement speed and jumping power of the character. You can set different values for the character's default, sprinting, and walking speeds.\n\n![movementmod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96493201/147374247-7a5c972e-b115-493d-8ca1-55e84ca97a97.png)\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96493201/147374247-7a5c972e-b115-493d-8ca1-55e84ca97a97.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1447550619-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1447550619-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"}}}
