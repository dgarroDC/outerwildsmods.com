Shortly after Outer Wilds Ventures repurposed ancient Nomai warp technology to travel to other stars, Carson was at one point discovered and is currently being researched. The star is currently home to **8** planets and **6** moons.\n\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-05-24-8414](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146765-ec123bf2-6683-45f0-b996-c6c99bdbbe8d.png)\n*Carson* is a large yellow dwarf star about halfway through its life cycle. Instead of going supernova like most other stars, once it runs out of hydrogen, it'll begin to fuse the helium into heavier elements and the star will expand into a red giant, before eventually shrinking down into a white dwarf.\n\n## Urath\n*Urath* is a green, Hearth-like planet. It has beautiful oceans for all to see, and fathers a quaint little moon named *Loon*.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-52-58-9861](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146794-23aa9074-1c03-4ca3-828a-4e1949631358.png)\n\n### Loon\n*Loon* is the quaint little moon hurtling around *Urath*. It is full of craters and riverbeds, some of which may have potentially had lava a long time ago.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-53-32-8204](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146804-151096be-1cad-4f66-ac8f-e3d270ef94e9.png)\n\n## Mirtha\n*Mirtha* is a red, dusty planet. The atmosphere is rather thin, but it has the potential of being terraformed by melting the polar ice caps.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-57-06-0569](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146818-263027d6-8722-4dc9-af9d-4657f3961e66.png)\n\n### Ekbur\n*Ekbur* is one of two moons that orbit *Mirtha*. It is a reddish-brown color and duels often with *Graebur*.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-57-28-8911](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146828-809f971b-9b96-4695-a2d2-5dc0bc6d2a9f.png)\n\n### Graebur\n*Graebur* is the gray twin of *Ekbur*. It is a little smaller and much more varied, with deeper craters and taller mountains compared to *Ekbur*. The composition of its stone is heavily durable and holds interesting properties. This moon should be investigated more.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-58-02-2251](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146865-6f759573-0241-48a9-9b88-4b459fd13480.png)\n\n## Dester\n*Dester* is a desert planet. It has plenty of cacti to go around. Make sure to clean any sand out of the suit's oxygen filters.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-55-38-9901](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146887-7fb0493b-79f1-4637-9f1b-f27f98e2fb17.png)\n\n## Alpinia\n*Alpinia* is an alpine planet, with fairly chilly temperatures and a beautiful ring. The oceans are dark and the grass is a dull shade, but it is pretty in its own right.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-54-26-6876](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146903-b88ae973-9b00-4218-9d0c-2355d9efafcf.png)\n\n## Volcus\n*Volcus* is a volcanic planet with thick clouds. It is also very hot, due to it being so close to the sun. Good luck surviving here.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-18-59-13-1595](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146933-506dddfb-42f4-472b-bb14-bc0f253c3cd2.png)\n\n## Platinum Hue\n*Platinum Hue* is a big gas giant. It has a pearlescent appearance, with the clouds containing mesmerizing pastel swirls in a beautiful sea of ivory. Nobody knows as of yet what lies beyond the enticing atmosphere, but it is highly recommended *not* to find out until further research is made.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-00-22-0092](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146952-0ef2bb79-1977-4a23-9a57-7910d4dc74a4.png)\n\n### Glaze\n*Glaze* is one of the moons from *Platinum Hue*. It is a frozen rock of ice with many canyons and valleys.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-00-48-0079](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146974-82d6fdf0-b8c6-492e-9ac8-10b42843dfd4.png)\n\n### Draeo\n*Draeo* is another moon orbiting *Platinum Hue*. It is a very dry planet without any sort of atmosphere, but samples could prove useful for research.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-01-25-9244](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146995-4e8982af-db2c-49ac-a143-5443a94c2dfa.png)\n\n## Scarlet Storm\n*Scarlet Storm* is another big gas giant in the system. It has a more aggressive shade of color, with a large ring adding onto its frightening appearance. It is highly recommended *not* to explore it until further research is made.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-03-52-4915](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191147023-b7537af7-ee45-4d0f-a9cf-cdf13f04248d.png)\n\n### Pyer\n*Pyer* is a cloudy moon that orbits *Scarlet Storm*. The atmosphere is composed of hydrogen cyanide. Take extreme caution when exploring.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-04-20-0911](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191147052-774e96ba-33e7-48b5-beaa-1eda670a0117.png)\n\n## Poylou\nA strange planet has appeared in the Carson system. *Poylou* appears to have high levels of radiation. It is unknown what is beneath the toxic clouds, but it is highly recommended *not* to find out until further research is made.\n![Screenshot-2022-09-19-19-02-19-3588](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191147068-48ea382e-8f96-4dd4-a572-efeaf867415a.png)\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/187900130-494fac0e-6e96-4b27-93a7-e5abf75ac30d.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1937425617-w800h3000finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1937425617-w800h3000finside.webp","width":800,"height":300,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146765-ec123bf2-6683-45f0-b996-c6c99bdbbe8d.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-101226904-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-101226904-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146794-23aa9074-1c03-4ca3-828a-4e1949631358.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1678913077-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1678913077-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146804-151096be-1cad-4f66-ac8f-e3d270ef94e9.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/2045408610-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/2045408610-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146818-263027d6-8722-4dc9-af9d-4657f3961e66.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-312601509-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-312601509-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146828-809f971b-9b96-4695-a2d2-5dc0bc6d2a9f.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1809855391-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1809855391-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146865-6f759573-0241-48a9-9b88-4b459fd13480.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/523598318-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/523598318-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146887-7fb0493b-79f1-4637-9f1b-f27f98e2fb17.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/907568967-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/907568967-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146903-b88ae973-9b00-4218-9d0c-2355d9efafcf.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1624626393-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1624626393-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146933-506dddfb-42f4-472b-bb14-bc0f253c3cd2.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-2128450111-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-2128450111-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146952-0ef2bb79-1977-4a23-9a57-7910d4dc74a4.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1364458990-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1364458990-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146974-82d6fdf0-b8c6-492e-9ac8-10b42843dfd4.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1024320865-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1024320865-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191146995-4e8982af-db2c-49ac-a143-5443a94c2dfa.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/2019342720-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/2019342720-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191147023-b7537af7-ee45-4d0f-a9cf-cdf13f04248d.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1535577534-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1535577534-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191147052-774e96ba-33e7-48b5-beaa-1eda670a0117.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/1361947350-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1361947350-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39398330/191147068-48ea382e-8f96-4dd4-a572-efeaf867415a.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-942558033-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-942558033-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"}}}
