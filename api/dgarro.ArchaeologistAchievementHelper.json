{"readme":"# Archaeologist Achievement Helper by Dami√°n Garro\n\n![thumbnail](images/thumbnail.png)\n\nMarks ship log entries that have missing facts required for the Archaeologist achievement as *\"There's more to explore here.\"*. It also lets you view which facts you haven't revealed!\n\n## Basic usage\n\nIn Outer Wilds, when an entry **isn't** displayed as *\"There's more to explore here.\"* it doesn't mean that all of its facts are revealed, there are some facts that don't affect that mark, and some of them are even required for the Archaeologist achievement. For example, the Timber Hearth Village entry has 2 facts that are needed for the achievement, but this entry is never marked as *\"There's more to explore here.\"*:\n\n![example-disabled](images/example-disabled.jpg)\n\nThis makes it difficult to know where to find the facts that you are missing for the achievement. The Archaeologist Achievement Helper mod forces *\"There's more to explore here.\"* to appear if there is at least one unrevealed fact that is required for Archaeologist:\n\n![example-enabled](images/example-enabled.jpg)\n\nThis feature helps you know in which entries there may be missing facts that you need for the achievement.\n\nThe mod also works with missing subentries that have facts required for the achievement, so the mark would also appear if the Zero-G Cave entry was missing.\n\n## Show all missing facts feature\n\nIf you need even more help, you can activate a setting to show all unrevealed facts that Archaeologist requires:\n\n![settings](images/settings.png)\n\nWhen you activate it the missing facts and subentries are shown like this (below the *\"There's more to explore here.\"* text, with the same color and starting with *\"MISSING FACT: \"* or *\"MISSING SUBENTRY: \"*):\n\n![example-disabled](images/example-showall.jpg)\n\n**Beware of spoilers**, only activate this option if you already beat the game, as this could reveal something important you don't know, although if you are using this mod you probably won the game and you are chasing the achievements.\n\nIf even with this option you are still unable to find the missing facts, I suggest going to the [Outer Wilds unofficial Discord server](https://discord.gg/kChJgBMmtd) and asking for help in `#archaeologist-achievement` channel (please remember to let them know which facts you have missing).\n\nThe site [outerwilds.ventures](https://outerwilds.ventures/) is also a great resource you can use to complete your entries!","externalImages":{"images/thumbnail.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-234138478-w800h260finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-234138478-w800h260finside.webp","width":800,"height":260,"format":"png"},"images/example-disabled.jpg":{"url":"/images/optimized/1891275815-w800h450finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1891275815-w800h450finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"jpeg"},"images/example-enabled.jpg":{"url":"/images/optimized/-502276612-w800h450finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-502276612-w800h450finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"jpeg"},"images/settings.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-780085741-w800h260finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-780085741-w800h260finside.webp","width":800,"height":260,"format":"png"},"images/example-showall.jpg":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1265771841-w800h450finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1265771841-w800h450finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"jpeg"}}}
