Given off by all _active_ statues.\n- Anti-Graviton Flux: Referred to in code as either \"WarpCore\" or \"White Hole\". Given off by all white holes (in warp cores or otherwise).\n- ???: An unused achievement indicates that there were originally signals planned for the DLC location. Given off by four sets of antennae. If you install [Achievements+](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-achievement-tracker) you can earn this achievement as well!\n\n![Nomai Statue signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/147978907-e9992559-d6c0-4441-b3ae-e2090b4551c7.png)\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/147869676-25f9b801-a4eb-449e-a624-9fc408c9518d.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/452669396-w800h500finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/452669396-w800h500finside.webp","width":800,"height":267,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/147978907-e9992559-d6c0-4441-b3ae-e2090b4551c7.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1807380785-w800h540finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1807380785-w800h540finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"}}}
