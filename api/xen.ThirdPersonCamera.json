If you rebind the X axis option for tools then it changes to whatever that is.\n\nScroll in/out to zoom in/out. There are options in settings to change the default zoom (useful when on controller since you can't scroll).\n\nThere are a few settings in the options menu:\n- Keep free look angle: You can freelook around your character while holding alt or the downward direction button (Gamepad). Toggling this option keeps the camera at that angle when you let go.\n- Use 3rd person by default: Determines if you start the game in 1st or 3rd person.\n\n![Using the translator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/143732387-f3c82062-37d5-46d5-8b06-11500168d55a.png)\n![Using autopilot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/143732389-5b8e5d94-0f57-4c93-b5af-cf5e7123e9c9.png)\n\n### Credits\n\nUses [free controller and keyboard prompts](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/) from Xelu, just like stock Outer Wilds.\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/146269240-54a849d0-1190-4fd5-bbca-3d5f885fd246.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-2023706984-w800h300finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-2023706984-w800h300finside.webp","width":800,"height":267,"format":"png"},"https://img.shields.io/github/manifest-json/v/xen-42/outer-wilds-third-person-camera?color=gree&filename=ThirdPersonCamera%2Fmanifest.json":{"url":"/images/optimized/1006615770-w96h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/1006615770-w96h20finside.svg","width":96,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/xen-42/outer-wilds-third-person-camera/total":{"url":"/images/optimized/505834646-w104h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/505834646-w104h20finside.svg","width":104,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/xen-42/outer-wilds-third-person-camera/latest/total":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1119822550-w132h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1119822550-w132h20finside.svg","width":132,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/143732387-f3c82062-37d5-46d5-8b06-11500168d55a.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/247932741-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/247932741-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/143732389-5b8e5d94-0f57-4c93-b5af-cf5e7123e9c9.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1945433741-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1945433741-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"}}}
