Also implements some QOL changes for third person perspectives:\n- Adds ghost model in dream world\n- Stops arm from disappearing when using tools\n- Puts the player's head back onto a layer where it can be seen.\n- Renders held tools properly\n- Handles compatibility between your mod and other CCU mods, and with [Day Dream](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/daydream/).\n\n## For use in other mods:\n\nInclude this interface in your mod.\n```cs\npublic interface ICommonCameraAPI\n{\n\tvoid RegisterCustomCamera(OWCamera OWCamera);\n\t(OWCamera, Camera) CreateCustomCamera(string name);\n\tUnityEvent<PlayerTool> EquipTool();\n\tUnityEvent<PlayerTool> UnequipTool();\n\tvoid ExitCamera(OWCamera OWCamera);\n\tvoid EnterCamera(OWCamera OWCamera);\n}\n```\n\nThen to use the API from another class:\n```cs\nvar CommonCameraAPI = ModHelper.Interaction.TryGetModApi<ICommonCameraAPI>(\"xen.CommonCameraUtility\");\n```\n\nIf you want to manually set up the camera yourself, be sure to call `RegisterCustomCamera` on it. However it's easier to just use `CreateCustomCamera` and the utility will set it up for you. Also includes some helpful events to hook on to.\n\nTo switch to your camera, use the `EnterCamera` method. To exit your camera, use the `ExitCamera` method. CCU will handle bringing the player back to the appropriate camera, be it from the base game or from another CCU mod.\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/190283897-380af8ee-2e51-47f2-bdb7-5c4dcfe282da.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-910116367-w800h438finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-910116367-w800h438finside.webp","width":800,"height":297,"format":"png"}}}
