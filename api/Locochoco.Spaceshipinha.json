{"readme":"# Spaceshipinha\n\n# ![Spaceshipinha](pictures/shipinha.png)\n\nAdds a custom ship simmilar to the one in the Outer Wilds Alpha mod [Navinha](https://github.com/ShoosGun/Navinha).\n\nThis vessel only knows one direction **foward!**. \n\nYou have full controll of the rotations, but for translation you only have two options: change the thruster power, or turn the thruster on. \n\nTo change the thruster power use the \"go up\" and \"go down\" inputs to increase or decrease it. \n\nAnd to turn the thruster on use the \"go foward\" input, be aware that it works in a binary fashion, so if you are using the controller a gentle push on the stick will make it go at full speed.\n","externalImages":{"pictures/shipinha.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1822207889-w800h318finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1822207889-w800h318finside.webp","width":800,"height":309,"format":"png"}}}
