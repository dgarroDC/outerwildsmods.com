{"readme":"# 21st Century Anglerfish\n\nThis mod is a complete meme.\n\nIt's built to make the anglerfish a little less intimidating (though for some, it may do the opposite).\n\nAnglerfish will no longer chase you, but instead when they hear you, they'll just look and stare after making a vine boom sound effect, and then continue staring until you leave.\n\nRelease V1.1.0: https://github.com/mrmeep321/21stCenturyAnglerfish/releases/tag/v1.1.0\n\n<!-- TOC -->\n","externalImages":{}}
