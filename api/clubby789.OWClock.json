It can be set to count up, or down to the sun exploding.\n\nThere's also an additional event logging system; upcoming events defined in `events.json` are displayed above the clock, turning red as they approach.\nNew events can be added from the pause menu (timestamp will be set to the current loop time).\n\n## Options\n - Count Up: Counts the elapsed seconds and minutes. When off, will count down to events/the end of the loop\n - Milliseconds: For speedrunners; uses millisecond timestamps\n - Events to Display: Number of upcoming events to display\n - Event List Width: Fraction of the available resolution that the event list can take up\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES\nRunning this during more intensive moments seem to sometimes cause a BSOD with CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (At least on my PC). If anyone has this issue (or a solution), please let me know.\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3955124/143557890-e64ad41d-9e19-4c10-9471-c2beaa1ed49b.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-185156581-w483h213finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-185156581-w483h213finside.webp","width":483,"height":213,"format":"png"}}}
