All the planets are tidally locked, with one side always facing their sun and the other \nalways facing away. Three of the planets are in the habitable zone, making the TRAPPIST-1 system one of the most \npromising known places to find extraterrestrial life.  \n  \nPlanet names are made up by me. Depictions are purely speculative, based on unfinished and contradictory research, not to mention the fact this is all \nmade in a video game. Check the sources for more accurate and in-depth info.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181838-7db42851-47d1-4681-9fd9-4d90fe460950.png)\n![d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181880-ecb8d6c7-2c67-4eed-bea1-a96eb0dc280f.png)\n![b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181888-e6277439-0729-4a94-b7b1-34bb405385b4.png)\n![h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181920-043b7f60-fb44-45e2-b435-4df008b9f4a7.png)\n![e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181931-cf698d86-4845-451f-b947-cefc7551d5ee.png)\n\n### Sources\n\n  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1\n  - https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1481/new-clues-to-compositions-of-trappist-1-planets/\n  - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-020-00719-1#Sec22  \n  - https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/05/aa32233-17/aa32233-17.html#S16\n  - https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2020.2277\n  - https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/05/aa32233-17/aa32233-17.html\n\n### Credits\n\nMars Perseverance Rover model by [NASA](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/models), thanks to Xen for creating the asset \nbundle.\n\nThanks to TerrificTrifid for giving me advice on scientific accuracy.\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181767-d7598083-0409-42ae-86b6-e582b3a11eb0.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/2119807413-w800h663finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/2119807413-w800h663finside.webp","width":800,"height":259,"format":"png"},"https://img.shields.io/github/manifest-json/v/Leopard501/TRAPPIST-1":{"url":"/images/optimized/-859414950-w96h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-859414950-w96h20finside.svg","width":96,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Leopard501/TRAPPIST-1/total":{"url":"/images/optimized/-728744947-w100h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-728744947-w100h20finside.svg","width":100,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Leopard501/TRAPPIST-1/latest/total":{"url":"/images/optimized/195824083-w140h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/195824083-w140h20finside.svg","width":140,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Leopard501/TRAPPIST-1":{"url":"/images/optimized/414654715-w132h20finside.svg","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/414654715-w132h20finside.svg","width":132,"height":20,"format":"svg"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181838-7db42851-47d1-4681-9fd9-4d90fe460950.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/233088268-w800h1280finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/233088268-w800h1280finside.webp","width":800,"height":500,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181880-ecb8d6c7-2c67-4eed-bea1-a96eb0dc280f.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/796074968-w800h1280finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/796074968-w800h1280finside.webp","width":800,"height":500,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181888-e6277439-0729-4a94-b7b1-34bb405385b4.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1134582796-w800h1280finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1134582796-w800h1280finside.webp","width":800,"height":500,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181920-043b7f60-fb44-45e2-b435-4df008b9f4a7.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/769169843-w800h1280finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/769169843-w800h1280finside.webp","width":800,"height":500,"format":"png"},"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43260601/154181931-cf698d86-4845-451f-b947-cefc7551d5ee.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-508143027-w800h1280finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-508143027-w800h1280finside.webp","width":800,"height":500,"format":"png"}}}
