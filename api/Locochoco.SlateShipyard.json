{"readme":"# Slate's Shipyard\n\n ![Slate's Shipyard](pictures/slatesShipyard.png)\n\nThis is a mod which allows the player to spawn custom ships on \"shipyards\" scattered on the solar system (by default). It **does not** come with default ships, but allows for the making of them and an easier set up.\n\n## Usage\nBy itself all this mod does is add locations with which other mods can use to spawn custom ships. If you want custom ships to play with, you have to download other mods like [Spaceshipinha](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/spaceshipinha/) or [Car Example](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/carexample/).\n\n## Sphiyards Location\nBy default there are several shipyards in different planets of the solar system:\n\n ![Village Shipyard](pictures/launchPadSpawner.png)\n \n ![Outside Village Shipyard](pictures/outsideVillageSpawner.png)\n \n ![Ember Twin Shipyard](pictures/htSpawner.png)\n \n ![Brittle Hollow Shipyard](pictures/bhSpawner.png)\n\n## API Usage\nTo use the API add this as a file in your project:\n```Csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\npublic class ISlateShipyardAPI \n{\n  public GameObject SpawnShipyard(Transform t, Vector3 localPosition, Vector3 localRotation);\n  public void DontSpawnDefaultShipyard();\n}\n```\nAnd do `ModHelper.Interaction.TryGetModApi<IGizmosAPI>(\"Locochoco.SlateShipyard\");` to be able to access the api calls. \n\nWith `SpawnShipyard` you can spawn the default shipyard anywhere you want (call this when the transform that is the parent is already loaded), this is specially usefull for New Horizons addons that delete Timber Hearth but want for players to spawn custom ships. \n\nAnd with `DontSpawnDefaultShipyard` you can make the mod not spawn the default spawner on Timber Hearth, you only need to call this once, and it will no longer attempt to spawn on the default location.\n","externalImages":{"pictures/slatesShipyard.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-418745802-w800h1020finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-418745802-w800h1020finside.webp","width":800,"height":318,"format":"png"},"pictures/launchPadSpawner.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1435838130-w800h3456finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1435838130-w800h3456finside.webp","width":800,"height":600,"format":"png"},"pictures/outsideVillageSpawner.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-835257071-w800h3456finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-835257071-w800h3456finside.webp","width":800,"height":600,"format":"png"},"pictures/htSpawner.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-22032980-w800h3456finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-22032980-w800h3456finside.webp","width":800,"height":600,"format":"png"},"pictures/bhSpawner.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/189392434-w800h3456finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/189392434-w800h3456finside.webp","width":800,"height":600,"format":"png"}}}
