{"readme":"## Outer Wilds Black Hole Portal Gun\n![Display_Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12672755/149048577-9e5aff45-e364-4a02-b393-9e23ca61cb35.PNG)\n\nShoot a linked pair of white and black holes with \"B\" (Black Hole) and \"G\" (White Hole). Once both holes have fired entering the black hole will take you out at the location of the white hole. Reshooting one of the two will delete the prior corresponding hole and link the new set. More stability and customization coming soon.\n\nKnown issues:\n- Launching a Nomai shuttle and teleporting will likely trap you inside it\n- Attaching a black hole to the ship can cause object to be deleted when the portal hits them\n\nThanks to [xen-42](https://github.com/xen-42 \"xen\") and [nebula_](https://github.com/misternebula \"nebula_\") for the black and white hole setup and object spawning respectively.\n","externalImages":{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12672755/149048577-9e5aff45-e364-4a02-b393-9e23ca61cb35.PNG":{"url":"/images/optimized/-1895518723-w800h1400finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-1895518723-w800h1400finside.webp","width":800,"height":438,"format":"png"}}}
