Check the [issues](https://github.com/shippy/outer-wilds-czech/issues) to see if it's already being worked on;\n2. If not, file an issue.\n3. Consider [contributing a fix](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Released version\n\nThis should be as easy as:\n\n1. Download and install the [Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://outerwildsmods.com/mod-manager/)\n2. Select \"Czech Localization\" from the list of mods\n3. Launch using the Mod Manager rather than your launcher of choice\n\n### Development version\n\n1. Download and install the [Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://outerwildsmods.com/mod-manager/),\n2.
